--- Built-in Replacements ---
This file contains built-in replacements to avoid repeating the same hard-coded values.
Replacements are denoted by the dollar-dollar curly braces token (e.g. $${starter_location_01}). The following details each built-in replacements that you can use:
`starter_location_01`: This is the primary Azure location sourced from the `starter_locations` variable. This can be used to set the location of resources.
`starter_location_02` to `starter_location_##`: These are the secondary Azure locations sourced from the `starter_locations` variable. This can be used to set the location of resources.
`starter_location_01_availability_zones` to `starter_location_##_availability_zones`: These are the availability zones for the Azure locations sourced from the `starter_locations` variable. This can be used to set the availability zones of resources.
`starter_location_01_virtual_network_gateway_sku_express_route` to `starter_location_##_virtual_network_gateway_sku_express_route`: These are the default SKUs for the Express Route virtual network gateways based on the Azure locations sourced from the `starter_locations` variable. This can be used to set the SKU of the virtual network gateways.
`starter_location_01_virtual_network_gateway_sku_vpn` to `starter_location_##_virtual_network_gateway_sku_vpn`: These are the default SKUs for the VPN virtual network gateways based on the Azure locations sourced from the `starter_locations` variable. This can be used to set the SKU of the virtual network gateways.
`root_parent_management_group_id`: This is the id of the management group that the ALZ hierarchy will be nested under.
`subscription_id_identity`: The subscription ID of the subscription to deploy the identity resources to, sourced from the variable `subscription_ids`.
`subscription_id_connectivity`: The subscription ID of the subscription to deploy the connectivity resources to, sourced from the variable `subscription_ids`.
`subscription_id_management`: The subscription ID of the subscription to deploy the management resources to, sourced from the variable `subscription_ids`.
`subscription_id_security`: The subscription ID of the subscription to deploy the security resources to, sourced from the variable `subscription_ids`.
